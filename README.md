[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anikamukherji/ImageProcessorS18.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anikamukherji/ImageProcessorS18)

Image Processing web app built using React for the BME 590 Spring 2018 final project that calls a server running on a Duke VM.

The module that `server.py` uses to process images is called `image_module` and is located within `Server/`. The frontend part of the project is located within `image_processor_app/`.

To see a more detailed explanation of the API and database models, reference [our RFC here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_w9FnVVjGPZUKfDKM6f4p6yuxf_UcSxSMd7z5Rzthxc/edit?usp=sharing)
